# GeoGuessr Image Based Location Retrieval

## **Intro**

GeoGuessr is a game that drops you in a random Google Street View location, anywhere in the world. The objective is to determine where you are. If you guess the exact location you'll earn 5000 points and if you guess the opposite side of the world you'll earn 0 points. There are many different modes of playing. This program is specifically for the "No Moving, Panning, or Zooming" mode where you have to guess the location based on a single image. There are also many different maps which have varying focuses such as region or type of location. This program works specifically with the "A Diverse World" map, one of the most popular maps in the game. The map hosts 50,000+ locations and prioritizes having locations from a diverse array of countries. 

## **Purpose**

This program retrieves the exact coordinates of the location within second(s). The program returns a google map link which can be used to pinpoint the exact location, allowing the user to earn a perfect score. The program does not access the website in any way, it strictly uses the image of the location provided.

## **User Set Up**

### Display Requirements:

1. Display should be a 16:9 aspect ratio. 
2. If you have multiple displays, the geoguessr window should be in your primary display. 

### Setting up Geoguessr:

1. Purchase GeoGuessr Pro or sign up for a free trial. The free version with 20 minutes of play per day will not work with this program. 
2. Open up a game of 'A Diverse World'. Link: https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/59a1514f17631e74145b6f47/play
3. To select the 'No Moving, Panning, or Zooming" mode, uncheck 'Use Default Settings' and check 'No move, no pan, no zoom'
4. After you start the game, open the settings, located in the bottom left corner. Toggle on Fullscreen
5. Also while in the settings, toggle on 'Classic Compass'.

### Setting up the Location Database: 

The program uses a database of location images from the diverse world map. 

1. Download here (~250mb): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NEH0feufXZj_C3yuK2zeZvNZmoubpyVD/view?usp=sharing. 
2. Extract the folder. Copy the path to the folder (shift-right click and 'copy as path') and save it somewhere. You will need it each time you start the program. 

## **Running the Program**

1. Enter in the path to the location database when prompted. 
2. Enter 'p'. Bring GeoGuessr to the foreground, enter fullscreen, and minimize any windows obstructing the game. 
3. Hit 0 when you are ready to search. Wait a moment and then navigate back to the shell. 
4. If a match is found, the program will print the google map link as well as copy it to your clipboard. 
5. Use the google map link in reference with the game map to pinpoint the exact location. 
6. When ready, enter the next round and repeat steps 2-5. 
7. When done playing, type 'q' to quit. 

Note: If you have multiple displays, consider pasting the google map link in a different window as opposed to clicking the link and opening it in the same window as the game. This prevents repeated toggling back and forth between full screen and regular. 

Note: If you get nonsensical compass estimates or multiple "No matches" in a row than there is likely an issue with one of the steps outlined above. 

## **Methodology**

The program works by comparing an image of the game location with the 50,000 images in the location database. Each database image has locational information such as the latitude, longitude, and directional heading. The database was created through web-scraping the game using Selenium. If the game image can be matched with an image in the location database, then the coordinates can be retrieved and a google maps link can be produced. 

The program uses a content based image retrieval (CBIR) algorithm to return the matching image. Each database image is compared with the game image and scored for similarity. To calculate the score, the program first obtains a 3d array of each image consisting of the pixel coordinates and RGB values. An array of differences is created by taking the absolute value of the first array subtracted by the second. The score is the sum of the values of this array divided by the number of pixels. A lower score is a better match. If a comparison yields a score under a specified threshold, the location information is returned and the match is found. However, comparing images is not fast. Only a couple hundred comparisons can be made per second and therefore linearly searching through the database of 50,000 images could take a few minutes. 

To solve this, the program estimates the directional heading from the game provided compass. Directional heading is the angular direction of where the camera is facing, for example 0 would be facing due north and 180 would be facing due south. The estimate calculated by the program is accurate within .5 degree on average, up to a max of 2 degrees. After estimating the heading, the program sorts the location images by the proximity of the heading to the estimate. This means the program only has to compare a couple hundred images instead of tens of thousands. This reduces the search time from a few minutes down to a couple seconds. 

To estimate the heading from the image of the compass, the program uses template matching. The program rotates a template of the compass incrementally and compares it against the image of the compass in the game. The comparison with the lowest score is the best match and therefore the estimate for the heading. As opposed to a threshold score, the program's goal is to find the minimum score over the range of angles. Like the CBIR algorithm, this is a slow process and linearly working through each angle is not optimal. To reduce the number of template matches, the program implements a ternary search algorithm. The template matching scores can be thought of as an asymmetric, unimodal, continuous function on the range of 0 to 360 with angles as the x-axis and scores as the y-axis. 

The goal of the algorithm is to estimate the minimum of the function while minimizing the number of calls. The program first calculates a score for angles at the 0, 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 marks of the range which are 0, 90, 180 and 270. The scores are compared and the angle with the lowest score is deemed the best match. A new search range is then generated by dividing the prior range in half around the best match. For example if the best match is 90 the new range would be 0 to 180. 

The function then compares the 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 markers of the new range (in this example, 45, 90, and 135). A new search range is once again generated by dividing the previous range in half around the best match. On each iteration, the new search range is made to be either the bottom half, middle half, or upper half of the prior search range. Each halving of the range compares 3 values but only calls the template matching function 1-2 times. The 1/2 value of each comparison was always calculated on the previous iteration and doesn't need to be recalculated. Furthermore, the 3/4 value doesn't need to be calculated if the 1/4 value is less than the 1/2 value. 

This process is repeated until the desired level of precision is met. In reality, many compasses aren't unimodal until within +/- 20 degrees. For example, if the compass is at 0, 180 might have a lower score than 30 even though 30 is closer. For this reason the program first iterates through angles in increments of 20 (instead of 90) to find the best match before proceeding with the ternary search algorithm. The end result takes 25-30 function calls to estimate the angle within .5 degrees as opposed to the 720 it would take searching linearly. This means it takes under a tenth of a second as opposed to 2+ seconds.
